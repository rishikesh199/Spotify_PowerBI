## üßÆ Suggested DAX Measures
*(Adapt table/column names as needed)*

```DAX
Total Songs = COUNTROWS(Songs)
Distinct Artists = DISTINCTCOUNT(Songs[artist_name])
Avg Popularity = AVERAGE(Songs[popularity])
Duration (Minutes) = DIVIDE(Songs[duration_ms], 60000)
Avg Duration (Minutes) = AVERAGE([Duration (Minutes)])

Explicit Songs = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Songs), Songs[explicit] = TRUE)
Non-Explicit Songs = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Songs), Songs[explicit] = FALSE)
Explicit Share % = DIVIDE([Explicit Songs], [Total Songs])
Non-Explicit Share % = DIVIDE([Non-Explicit Songs], [Total Songs])

Max Popularity by Artist = CALCULATE(MAX(Songs[popularity]), ALLEXCEPT(Songs, Songs[artist_name]))
Avg Popularity by Artist = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Songs[popularity]), ALLEXCEPT(Songs, Songs[artist_name]))
Top Song Popularity = RANKX(ALL(Songs[song_name]), [Song Popularity], , DESC)
Song Popularity = AVERAGE(Songs[popularity])

Avg Popularity by Month =
    CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Songs[popularity]),
               TREATAS(VALUES('Calendar'[Month]), Songs[month]))

Distinct Songs by Year =
    CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Songs[song_name]),
               TREATAS(VALUES('Calendar'[Year]), Songs[year]))

#1 Positions by Artist =
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Songs), Songs[position] = 1)

Avg Tracks per Album = AVERAGEX(VALUES(Albums[album_id]), Albums[track_count])
Songs per Artist = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Songs), ALLEXCEPT(Songs, Songs[artist_name]))
